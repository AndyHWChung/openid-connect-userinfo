# Scopes

Access to user information is controlled through scopes. Each access token (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token) is associated with a set of scopes at login. When a request is made for user information, only information belonging to the provided scopes is returned.

Here is a list of supported scopes and the claims/fields they contain.
